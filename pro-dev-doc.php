			<h2>Golden circle</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>I want to bring the Arts to children who otherwise might never see a future where art can be a reality.<br>
				A child who attends a performing arts school becomes The Fugees.<br>Those children that could never attend such a school listen to the Fugees.</li>
				<li>Locally first, then wherever it can help.</li>
				<li>As a victim of childhood sexual abuse who also suffered from ADHD when no one knew what it was, I was literally<br>
				a forgotten child.  I saw no future where anything could be creative or beautiful.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>version 1</li>
				<li>My name is Jeffrey Brink, and I am a New Mexico trained full stack web designer and developer committed to connecting children who will benefit from the arts with the arts and artists who can show them a positive future through creation.</li>
				<li>version 2</li>
				<li>words words words</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
			<p>This is where a paragraph should go, but I missed what he said about the paragraph so I wrote this.
			</p>
			<p>I use my whole brain very seldomly.  With my ADHD it is hard to ever break out of my right brain habits and be analytical.  I have started taking medications recently to help and they seem to be working.</p>
		<div>
			<h2>Weekly reflections</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>week 0</li>
				<br>Looking back on week zero I am both satisfied with my performance and a little disappointed with myself.
				<br>I am giving everything I can but can't shake the feeling that I am being simply outworked by my cohort companions.
				<br>Overall I am pleased with both the choice I made to attend Deep Dive and my growing profeciency.
				<br>Learning this week that front-end UI/UX designers that are also developers are in great demand showed me where I fit into the industry.
				<br>
				<br>
				<li>week 1</li>
				<br>My reflections on week 1 are simply a blur of information and stress.  I'm not sure if the train is coming to give me a ride or run me over.
				<br>
				<br>
				<li>week 2</li>
				<br>Well, know I know that the train definitely wasn't coming to pick me up.  I am stressed, but hopeful.  If I can get through this data stuff I will love my job.
			</ul>

		<div><h3>After googling myself both as a data search and an image search,<br>
			  I found I have a very small online presence.  This should make it<br>
				easier to keep my personal life seperate from my private life.

		<br>
		<h2>Worth Questions</h2>
		<h3>Internal factors that keep me from acheiving my goals are:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Fear</li>
			<li>The ability to make any situation stressful.</li>
			<li>Guilt</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>External factors that keep me from acheiving my goals are:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><h1>Family</h1></li>
			<li>Perception</li>
			<li>Lack of education/experience</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<h3>How do you personally create value for others?</h3>
		     I create value for others by assuming the roles of people<br>
			  they would have to pay for the services they ask me to do for free.
			  If you need a plumber, Call Jeff.  Never mind that he knows NOTHING<br>
			  plumbing.  The amount of time I spend troubleshooting other peoples<br>
			  systems without compensation is mind boggling.

		<h3>Has anyone ever told you that you have potential professionally?  Do you believe it?</h3>
		I have been told that I could possibly make a career out of photography, film editing, and the sub-specialty<br>
		careers that exist therein.  I have never believed them because my self-respect is too low to think that<br>
		I could ever pull it off.  Plus, the people that tell me these things are never the people who could actually<br>
		help make it happen.
